# Serato-Simplified-Project
Created a Simplified Version of Serato

Chose to recreate a simplified version of Serato.com. I created a bootstrap website that is responsive to different screen sizes. Started with the navigation bar with three links labeled home, about, and contact. The navber is responsive and displays a hamburger menu for smaller screens. I then created the footer displaying rights data. I placed the codes for the nabber and footer for each page. 

My home page includes the header and a hero section. I created a javascript function for the rotation. In the header, I included a button that is linked to the contact page. For my hero section, I included some features with an image and brief description inside a flex container. There is a carousel that rotates every three seconds with images related to Serato. The carousel is functioned to rotate with JavaScript functions in a separate file.

The about page has brief about text that is in a container to be centered in the page. All text is centered within the container. I created some cards that displays  and image for each product with information from Serato. Within each card is a button displaying learn more that links to the contact page. There is a table that lists a product comparison for each product listed on this site. Serato offers more but this is a simplified version.

The contact page has a form that is required to fill out with the information listed. Below the form is an acordian that displays FAQs. The form and accordion are responsive to different screen sizes.

Aside from bootstrap styles in the HTML, there is a css style sheet for other styles needed for this project.

The JavaScript file includes five different functions of JS. Functionss are for the carousel, to toggle the accordion for FAQs, to display a success message when sending requests, to validate form fields, and for smooth scrolling to selections.
